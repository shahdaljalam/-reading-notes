### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
table based data.

### Give a real world example.

### What is a realational database?

### What is a NoSQL database?
NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are nontabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model.

### Howo does it work?
One way of understanding the appeal of NoSQL databases from a design perspective is to look at how the data models of a SQL and a NoSQL database might look in an oversimplified example using address data.

### What is inside of a Mongo database?
We have collections instead of tables, and inside collections we have documents.

### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB is more flexible, because you store your data where ever you want

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
Having duplicated data.
