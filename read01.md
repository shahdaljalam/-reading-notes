HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format.

## **1- HTML structure :** ##

The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.

`<DOCTYPE! html>`: This is the document type declaration (not technically a tag). It declares a document as being an HTML document. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.

`<html>`: This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.

`<head>`: The head tag contains the “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren’t visible on the front-end of a webpage.

`<body>`: the body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front-end.

 ## **2- Markup :** #

Markup refers to how you can structure or format content.
HTML is called a Markup language because it allows users to organize the look and presentation of all the content that needs to go on a web page.

## **3- HTML layout :** #
HTML layout represents the arrangement of all the elements in the document. It is an important part of basic page design.
Basic Elements of Website Layouts
A well-made HTML layout improves user experience in two significant ways:

Simplifies navigation by clarifying the structure
Makes the design more visually appealing
There are four basic elements you will find in pretty much every page layout design:

Part|Definition|Tags
----|----|----
Header | The very top of the page  | `<header>`
Navigation bar |An HTML container for hyperlinks to different parts of the website|`<nav>`
Content|The main content of the webpage|`<article>`, `<section>` and others
Footer|The very bottom of the page (usually authorization data, e.g., copyright info)|`<footer>`

## **4- Process and design :** ##
In order to design, build, and launch your website, it's important to follow these steps:
- Goal identification. The initial stage is all about understanding how you can help your client.  
- Sitemap : It helps us organize our content and present what we want visitors to see in an organized way
- wireframe : Wireframes provide a clear overview of the page structure, layout, information architecture, user flow, functionality, and intended behaviors.
## ** 5- the ABC's of programming :** ##
