1- Difference Between Web Application and Website.
Websites mostly consist of simple HTML-based architecture and only serve as a platform to display information rather than interact and make transactions with the user. The web pages may contain text, images, or music. For example.
Sometimes JavaScript and CSS are also used.

 Web applications like Facebook, Gmail, YouTube, eBay, Twitter, and Amazon, these websites use a username and password to verify the user identity and allow users to interact and communicate with the servers through the applications available on the webpage.

4-  the difference between a text editor and a coding editor
A text editor simply allows you to write and edit text and it does not have anything built-in to help you to code whereas a code editor is also a text editor but it also helps you write code.
