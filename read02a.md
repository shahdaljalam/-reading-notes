# What is Markdown? #
When you add bold, italics, numbered lists, bullet points, headings, and so on to text, you’re “formatting” it. Markdown is a syntax—or, set of rules—that formats text on web pages.
How Do You Use Markdown?
To use Markdown, you just apply simple tags to your text. For example, to format text in italics, you put underscores around it like so:``` _this is some text in italics_.```

Here are some other examples of Markdown formatting from the syntax guide:

Headers

`# This is an H1 `

`## This is an H2`

`###### This is an H6`

Bullet Points
```
* Red
* Green
* Blue
```

Numbered Lists
```
1. Bird
2. McHale
3. Parish
```

Emphasis (Italics)
```
*text*
_text_
```
