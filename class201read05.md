# Images #
There are several things to consider when selecting and preparing images for your site, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.


## Adding Images
 The < img > tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The < img > tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The < img > tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed 

## How to determine height & Width of Images

height : This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
width : This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

# Color
Foreground Color color : The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

- rgb values : These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
- hex codes : These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
- color names : There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan CSS 3: HSL Colors
CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values

- HUE : Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.

- Saturation
is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.

- LighTness : Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness is represented as a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness is sometimes referred to as luminosity

## Text
Typeface Terminology :

Sans-Serif : Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design. Screens have a lower resolution than print. So, if the text is small, sans-serif fonts can be clearer to read.

Serif : Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs. In print, serif fonts were traditionally used for long passages of text because they were considered easier to read.

Monospace : Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.) Monospace fonts are commonly used for code because they align nicely, making the text easier to follow. Techniques That Offer a Wider Choice of Typefaces
