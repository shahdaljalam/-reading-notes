# **Structure Web Pages with HTML** #

The website should be designed for the target audience, be it individuals or companies.
The motivations and goals of the website visitors must be considered.
- are they looking for general entertainment or do they need to achieve a specific goal?
- Are they already familiar with the service or product that you offer or do they need to be introduced to it?

 A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site.

## Writing the Code ##
Once you understand how the picture looks like, its incredibly simple to write the HTML. 


- The ``` <!DOCTYPE html> ``` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
- The ``` <html> ``` element is the root element of an HTML page.
- The ``` <head> ``` element contains meta information about the HTML page
- The ``` <title> ``` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
- The ``` <body> ``` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
- The ``` <h1> ``` element defines a large heading
- The ``` <p> ``` element defines a paragraph
