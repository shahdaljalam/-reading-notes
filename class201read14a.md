# transform #
The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model.
The CSS transform function allows you to create basic transform animations such as rotations, movements, scales, and skews on a web page.

## 1- translate() Transformation ##
The translate() method is used to move an element from its current position to a new position on the screen.
## 2- rotate() Transformation ##
The rotate() transformation allows you to rotate an element clockwise or counter-clockwise. The extent to which an item is rotated is based on a given degree value.
## 3- scale() Transformation ##
The scale() method allows you to increase or decrease the size of an element.
## 4- scaleX() Transformation ##
The scaleX() transformation allows you to increase or decrease the width of an element. 
## 5- scaleY() Transformation ##
The scaleY() transformation allows you to increase or decrease the height of an element. 

**scaleY() works in the same way as scaleX(), but instead of affecting the width of an element, scaleY() changes the height of the element.**

# 3D Transforms #

Following are the 3D transformation functions in CSS:

- translate3d(x,y,z): It provides the 3D translation and moves the element along with the X, Y, and Z axis.
- translateX(x): It specifies the 3D translation by moving the element along with X-axis.
- translateY(y): It specifies the 3D translation by moving the element along with Y-axis.
- translateZ(z): It specifies the 3D translation by moving the element along with Z-axis.
- scale3d(): It provides the 3D scale translation and scales the element along with the X, Y, and Z axis.
- rotate3D(): It provides the 3D rotation with the specified angle along with X, Y, and Z direction.
- matrix3D(): It defines the 4*4 transformation matrix of 16 values.
- perspective(n): It describes a vision of perspective for an element transformed in 3D. In addition, the element will appear further away from the viewer as the value of such a function rises.
