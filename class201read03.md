# HTML Lists #

HTML provides us three different types of lists :

- Ordered lists `<ol>` (used to group a set of related items in a specific order.)
- Unordered lists `<ul>` (used to group a set of related items in no particular order.)
- Definition lists `<dl>` ( used to display name/value pairs such as terms and definitions.)

# The CSS Box Model #

In CSS, the "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

Explanation of the different parts:

- Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
- Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
- Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
- Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

# The control flow with js #
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

**Conditional** statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
if â€¦ else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

**Loop** can execute a block of code a number of times.
## Different Kinds of Loops : ##
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

- `for - loops` through a block of code a number of times
- `for/in - loops` through the properties of an object
- `for/of` - loops through the values of an iterable object
- `while` - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

## JavaScript switch Statement ##
The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

 how switch Statement works ? :

- The switch expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
- If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
