# CSS Layout

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

# Type of position

type of position element:

 1- Normal flow
 Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one.

2- Relative Positioning
This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed. This does not affect the position of surrounding elements; they stay in the position they would be in in normal flow.

3- Absolute positioning
This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow.


4- Fixed Positioning
This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element. Elements with fixed positioning do not affect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when the user scrolls up or down the page.

Floating Elements
 Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.
